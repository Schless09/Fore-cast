*Share this with your league! Here are the slick little advancements that make the experience better.*

## 🏌️ Live Leaderboard

### Picks vs Prize — One Tap
The rightmost column on the live leaderboard toggles between **Picks** and **Prize**:
- **Picks** — How many teams in your league drafted each golfer. Spot chalk vs contrarian plays.
- **Prize** — Projected prize money at each position (split for ties).
*Click the column header to switch.*

### Hole-by-Hole Scorecards
Tap the **Today** column cell for any golfer to open their **scorecard**:
- Birdies (red circles), bogeys (blue squares), eagles (double gold circles)
- Front nine / back nine layout
- Current round and all completed rounds

### Suspended Play Updates
When play is suspended (rain, darkness, etc.), a banner appears with a link to **@PGATOURComms** on X for live updates.

### Real-Time Refresh
Scores auto-update every 2 minutes. A countdown shows when the next refresh runs; you can also hit **Refresh** for an immediate update.

## 📊 Weekly Standings

### "Who Else Has My Players?"
During an active or completed tournament, **click any player name** in the expanded roster:
- Click **one** player → expand all teams that have that golfer
- Click **multiple** players → expand only teams with all of them (AND logic)
- Selected players highlight in gold; use **Clear filter** to reset

Handy for spotting overlap with opponents and planning future picks.

### Expand / Collapse
- Expand a team row to see their full roster and live winnings
- **Expand All** / **Collapse All** for quick scans
- Your team auto-expands when you open the page

## 🏆 Season Standings

### Segments
Leagues can define **segments** (e.g., FedEx Cup style). Toggle between **Full Season** and each segment to see period-specific rankings.

### Live Active Tournament
If there’s an active tournament, your league’s live winnings for that event are included in season standings—no waiting for final sync.

---

## ⏰ Roster & Tournaments

### Lineup Countdown
A countdown shows time until **lineup locks** (first tee time). When it’s close (under 6 hours), it turns orange as a reminder.

### "Current Week" in Selectors
Tournament and weekly standings selectors mark the **current week** and default to the active tournament. Easy to jump straight to what matters.
