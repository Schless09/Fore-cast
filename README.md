For a concise product and architecture overview (e.g. for LLMs), see **[PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md](./PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md)**.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL); **Auth**: Clerk
- **Deployment**: Vercel (free tier)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account (free tier works)
- Supabase project with the provided credentials

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd golfstats-supabase
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file in the root directory (`.env.local` is recommended as it's automatically ignored by git):
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Important**: Replace `your_anon_key_here` with your actual Supabase anonymous key from your Supabase dashboard.

**Troubleshooting**: If you encounter "Invalid API Key" errors, visit `/env-check` to verify your environment variables are set correctly. See [ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Database Setup

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
3. Run the SQL migration to create all tables, RLS policies, and triggers
4. Enable real-time on the following tables in Supabase Dashboard → Database → Replication:
   - `tournament_players`
   - `user_rosters`
   - `roster_players`

### Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Sign Up/Login**: Create an account or sign in
2. **Browse Tournaments**: View available PGA Tour tournaments
3. **Create Roster**: Select up to 6 players for a tournament
4. **View Leaderboard**: See your personalized leaderboard with only your players
5. **Track Scores**: Watch real-time updates as your players compete

### For Admins

1. **Add Players**: Add PGA Tour players to the `pga_players` table
2. **Create Tournaments**: Create tournaments in the `tournaments` table
3. **Link Players to Tournaments**: Add players to `tournament_players` table
4. **Update Scores**: Use the admin scores page or API to update player scores
5. **Recalculate Points**: Trigger fantasy point recalculation after score updates

## Weekly Tournament Setup

Since you'll be uploading players weekly for each tournament:

1. **Add Players** (if new):
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO pga_players (name, country, world_ranking, is_active)
   VALUES ('Player Name', 'Country', 10, true);
   ```

2. **Create Tournament**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO tournaments (name, course, start_date, end_date, status)
   VALUES ('Tournament Name', 'Course Name', '2024-01-01', '2024-01-04', 'upcoming');
   ```

3. **Link Players to Tournament**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO tournament_players (tournament_id, pga_player_id)
   SELECT 'tournament-uuid', id FROM pga_players WHERE name IN ('Player 1', 'Player 2', ...);
   ```

## Live scores and sync (ESPN + RapidAPI)

Live leaderboards use two sources:

- **ESPN** — Refreshed every 2 minutes on tournament days; used for in-play leaderboard and scorecards. No rate limit.
- **RapidAPI** (Live Golf Data) — Runs once per day (6 AM UTC); updates tee times, final positions, and winnings. Used for official wrap-up and DB persistence.

Crons: `espn-sync` (every 2 min), `auto-sync` (every 4 min, activation only), `rapidapi-daily` (once/day). See **[AUTO_SCORING_SETUP.md](./AUTO_SCORING_SETUP.md)** and **[PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md](./PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md)** for details.
