SUBJECT: Quick tips: Get more out of FORE!cast Golf

Hi everyone,

Here are a few features that can make the experience a lot better — worth knowing if you haven’t tried them yet.

LIVE LEADERBOARD

• Picks vs Prize — The rightmost column toggles between how many teams drafted each golfer (Picks) and projected prize money (Prize). Click the column header to switch.

• Hole-by-hole scorecards — Click the Today column cell for any golfer to open their full scorecard (birdies, bogeys, eagles, etc.).

WEEKLY STANDINGS — "Who else has my players?"

During an active or completed tournament, click any player name in the expanded roster:

• Click one player → expand all teams that have that golfer  
• Click multiple players → expand only teams with all of them (AND logic)  
• Selected players highlight in gold; use Clear filter to reset

Useful for spotting overlap with opponents and planning future picks.

CO-MANAGERS

You can invite a friend to co-manage your roster. They can build and edit your lineup, see your team as "You" in standings, and you share an invite link from League Settings → Co-Managers.



I'm always open to product feature suggestions or hearing about bugs. Use the FEEDBACK link (in the app menu) to reach me directly.

That's it. Enjoy the season.
